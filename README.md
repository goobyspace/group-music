# Shortwave

WoW Addon that lets you create playlists of music, ambience & sounds as well as play these playlists for your whole group!

# Developing

To update the data to more recent versions of WoW, run the following command:

```
npm start

This will fill the ShortWave_Data folders, with the most recent sound files, taken from the latest listfile in the [wowdev listfile repo](https://github.com/wowdev/wow-listfile).
